  # ATTENRION! The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  # resources :products
  
  resources :users do
    resources :uvps do
      post :update_inline_content, on: :collection
    end
  end
  resources :uvps

  resources :sessions, only: [:new, :create, :destroy]

  # MÃœLL
  #resources :microposts, only: [:create, :destroy]
  resources :microposts do
    post :update_row_order, on: :collection
  end

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root  'static_pages#home'

  # Example of regular route:
  # get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  match '/signup',  to: 'users#new',            via: 'get'
  match '/signin',  to: 'sessions#new',         via: 'get'
  match '/signout', to: 'sessions#destroy',     via: 'delete'
  match '/help',    to: 'static_pages#help',    via: 'get'
  match '/about',   to: 'static_pages#about',   via: 'get'
  match '/impressum', to: 'static_pages#impressum', via: 'get'
  match '/news', to: 'static_pages#news', via: 'get'
  
  #match '/users/update_inline_content', to: 'uvps#update_inline_content', via: 'post'
